ByteController
==============

An OS X menu bar application for controlling iTunes, Spotify and VLC.

This software is open-source and donationware. Please make a donation at

This is my first project, and it is just an otherwise unchanged fork of
the original (as I have no coding knowledge whatsoever, just a lot of
graphic design experience and a keen eye for UI and UX), with skins I
crafted to match the default look of menu extras replacing the more
skeumorphic and complicated ones.

Feel free to use the included .SVG, .PDF, .AI .EPS and .AFDESIGN template
files if you wish to make your own skins, since it took me a while to
figure out the optimal button and label dimensions and which background
colours to use in order to coax ByteController skins into matching the
default menu bar selection colours as closely as possible in each version
of macOS.

The project I forked it from was one of the original contributor's first
Cocoa projects, so the code can be a bit messy at places, and if you need
assistance please contact the original contributor. If you make any
modifications to the app, please share your contributions.
You will be credited.

Shouldn't be harder than opening the XCode-project and pressing Run.
