This is my first project, and it is just a fork of with added skins. I have no coding knowledge whatsoever, but a lot of graphic design experience and a keen eye for UI and UX. It was one of the original contributor's first Cocoa projects, so the code can be a bit messy at places. If you make any modifications to the app, please share your contributions. You will be credited.

Shouldn't be harder than opening the XCode-project and pressing Run.
